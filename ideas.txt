try using postgres builtin full text search engine and compare to the one you build
that would look like this:
    you would have the unaltered text of a document in the db, content TEXT field,
    and also a content_vector TSVECTOR field
    
    UPDATE documents
    SET content_vector = to_tsvector('english', content);

    then you would need to make a reverse index, or a GIN (general reverse index)

    CREATE INDEX idx_content_vector ON documents USING GIN(content_vector);

    to search:
    SELECT id, url, content
    FROM documents
    WHERE content_vector @@ plainto_tsquery('english', 'llvm')
    ORDER BY ts_rank(content_vector, plainto_tsquery('english', 'llvm')) DESC
    LIMIT 10;

    there are more commands than plainto_tsquery, maybe look into it
    you can also do some dumb stuff like highlight the text.
